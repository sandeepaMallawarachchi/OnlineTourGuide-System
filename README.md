The online tour guide system is a comprehensive dynamic web application built using Java, designed to facilitate the connection between tourists and tour guides. It features complete CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tour information. The system incorporates secure user authentication (login/register) and detailed profile management. Tour guides can manage tour listings, while tourists can browse, book, and review tours. Developed with Java servlets, JSP, and backed by a MySQL database, the application ensures efficient data handling and a seamless user experience. It offers an intuitive interface for effortless navigation, enhancing the overall travel planning process.

### OOP Concepts Applied:

  * Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Singleton Design Pattern
By leveraging these OOP principles, the online tour guide system achieves a modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase, enhancing both development efficiency and user experience.

My Contributions to the Project:

- Login/Register
- User Dashboard
- Reserve Tours
- Update/Delete Tours
- Accept/Reject Reserved Tours

These contributions ensured that the system provides a seamless experience for both tourists and tour guides, resulting in a well-structured and functional application that enhances the overall travel planning process.
